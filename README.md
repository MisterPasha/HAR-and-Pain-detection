# Wearable activity recognition: Characterising sensor data misalignments & the robustness of a machine learning model
This study investigates the often-overlooked issue of sensor misalignment caused by hardware limitations, clock drift, software delays, and communication lags, even when using identical sensor models configured at the same sampling rates. Through systematic experiments using custom-built sensor prototypes and the REALDISP dataset, this work characterises the sources of misalignment and evaluates its impact on HAR performance under varying sensor configurations and activity transitions. Results show that misalignment degrades classification accuracy—particularly in reduced-sensor setups or during activity transitions—and that augmentation can improve robustness, although with limitations. These findings provide valuable insights for designing more reliable HAR systems in real-world settings.
